Just in case you are wondering what the problem is, my documents are not named _Document1 [Compatibility Mode]_ and _Document2 [Compatibility Mode]_.  They are called... well it doesn't matter what they are called but it's not this!  I'm sure you can imagine what it's like having to use 2 programs to figure out what I'm looking at.  And yes, these documents were originally created by Microsoft Word (for Windows, no doubt).

I'm uninstalling Office 2008 this afternoon.  I'm tired of this crap.
