Yet another design flaw in the iPhone.  The speakerphone worked great for a long time.  Then one day, it got so quiet I couldn't use it anymore.  I tried a volume hack when it was jail-broken but to no success.  My problem wasn't a bad speaker, it was the iPhone equivalent of ear-wax.

While pocket lint is nothing more than a nuisance for you and me, to the iPhone, it's kryptonite.  The phone has little holes on the bottom so sounds can go through.  And you know what?  Those little holes eat pocket lint for breakfast, lunch, _and_ dinner.

_The little holes in question._

Only the holes on the left (if you are holding the phone during regular usage) are utilized when playing music or using the speakerphone.  Take a peek down there.  Do you see any white, gray, or anything in those holes?  If yes, please read on. If not, then I can't help you.  Move along.

Now, I have to warn you that if you do this too hard you can damage your phone and/or void your warranty.  But, you probably don't care, do you?  I didn't think so.  So go grab your handy-dandy iPhone speaker-hole cleaner.  Don't have one?  Just use a bulletin board stick-pin.

_It's hard to see, but it's slightly bent at the end.  Perfect!_

Just gently fish it around in each hole.  It should come out with a little time.  Be patient.  Push too hard and you could damage your speaker.  That would suck.  I blew a little in mine and a bunch of junk came out.  A couple minutes later, the speakerphone was working great again.  Hope this helps you!
