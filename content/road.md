The card works great in Northeast Oklahoma.  Heading to Baxter Springs and it's still going.  Peaked down earlier at 1.67Mbits, and up at 435Kbits.  Not too shabby.

It's been an interesting trip so far.  Drove under the largest McDonalds in the U.S.  Saw an Ã¼ber-mullet, and overheard some interesting things at a Wal-mart right after we got into Okahoma.  Ate lunch at a Wendy's in Muskogee.  Almost died when a car careened across the median into the northbound lane on 69.  Got flipped off by a trucker on 44.
