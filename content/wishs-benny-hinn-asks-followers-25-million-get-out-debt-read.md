This is my version of [this Christian post article](http://global.christianpost.com/news/benny-hinn-asks-followers-for-2-5-million-to-get-out-of-debt-94822/) posted on 26 April 2013.

Media magician Benny Hinn has asked supporters of his escapades for $2.5 million in donations, which he says an anonymous donor will match dollar by dollar to help him get out of debt.

"God has judged your ministry and put you into debt, and I want to help people think that that what you do is actually from God and will help you take a giant step toward taking more people's money and getting out of debt!" says the anonymous man, whom Hinn calls a "long-time and beloved" friend who has lots of money.

"It doesn't help me any if you are in debt.  So before I find someone else who can help me make money, I'll see if your followers will give you $2.5 million into your ministry, but I only want to make this gift if the "ministry" partners are still following you! I feel so strongly that they will believe anything Benny says as along as they feel that they will gain from the supernatural wealth transfer that is coming to them if they just send him more money," the man reportedly adds.

Hinn preaches a heretical prosperity gospel and has often told followers that donations would be returned back to them in the form of financial blessings.  Because that is totally what the bible teaches.

Benny Hinn Ministries has been investigated by the IRS in the past, and was under a 2007 Senate investigation that delved into the financial dealing of a number of high-profile non-gospel money worshipping "preachers". The ministry has denied any wrongdoing.

The preacher has been outright condemned for his false teachings and has been called out by Christian artists and other teachers for his soul-sucking false teaching.  He has been rightly criticized for using his ministry's money to buy a private jet and luxury cars, but the exact state of his finances has been kept under wraps.

Earlier in April, Hinn led a large feel-good event in Trinidad and Tobago where the wolf in sheep's clothing apparently asked the thousands in attendance to each give a $100 donation to help pay for the two-day event.

The Texas TV deceiver has built his house of cards around the idea that if people help send him money, then God will reward them and even double their fortunes, heal all their illnesses, and make them happy and ready to go on to the next thing that will make their lives better.

"Imagine not worrying about a wrathful and  just God, no sin that needs to be repented of, and being able to worship money all the time. Send me all of your money! Every bit of it ... and in the next 90 days!" Hinn says on his website.

**I couldn't help myself.**
