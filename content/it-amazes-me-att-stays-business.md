* I can never get someone to call me back.  They only respond if I happen to get them on the phone or I start sending e-mails.
* With our account rep, there is always an excuse: "I was out of the office, family emergency" or "I was away from my desk" or "our unicorn was have babies."
* The tone of our account reps voice doesn't seem to be "I'm glad you got me on the phone because you're going to spend more money with me" but rather "I don't want to talk to you right now so let me get this done so I can get off the phone"
* The answers to my questions aren't correct.  Maybe it's just my rep, but she likes to answer questions she thinks I'm asking, and not what I really asked.
* Have you ever had them do something right the first time?  Me neither.
* [Working to](http://libcom.org/organise/work-to-rule) [the rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule.)
* It's all fun and games until it's 7:30 pm on a friday, and you've got 7 people on a conference call trying to figure out a single problem.
* It's no wonder they are unionized.  If they didn't have them, most of them would be out of a job because they are *useless!*
* They want you to pay for mistakes because you "signed off" on a change order that had the mistake on it.
* Have you ever *seen* their change orders?  I'd rather try to order chinese food from a hieroglyphic menu written in egyptebonics!
* Voicemails go nowhere.  I end up calling back every 30 minutes in order to talk to someone.
* Know why AT&T gives you an account team?  Because 2 out of those 3 people will never answer!
* After looking at how we were serviced, I'm starting to wonder if the NSA warrantless wiretapping stuff even worked!
