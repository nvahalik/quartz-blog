A few months ago, I started taking Lexapro to help my anxiety... they worked great... until they didn't.  Then my doctor switched me over to Cymbalta.  After a few weeks, I started having crazy nightmares and insomnia.  I visited my doctor last week and told him that I'd rather just get off of it.  He said that since I was only on 10mg I could just stop taking it.

That was Thursday.  That was my last dose.  Sunday afternoon I started getting cold sweats, dizziness, nausea, etc.  I slept most of that afternoon and evening.  Monday morning I felt better and ended up going to work the next day.  That lasted until right after lunch.  I got even more dizzy and nauseous.  Today I went to work and did great until vomiting right before lunch.  I felt great, but after lunch ended up going to my girlfriend's house to sleep and couldn't wake up.

My body is sore, and I feel completely tired.  I haven't driven any distance since Sunday.  Worse yet, I've been reading that some people continue having these symptoms for weeks (not days).

I'm going to the doctor tomorrow... please pray that I can get over this crap soon.
