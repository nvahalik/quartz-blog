I've been pretty quiet on here for the past month or so.  Things have been pretty crazy.  Two(ish) weeks ago I moved to Temple, TX.  I know what some of you are thinking but I have to honestly say that I thought I was going to die of boredom here.  Turns out I've barely been able to sit down and hack around on fun stuff like I normally did.

Moving here was great.  Now, however, the real task is going to be prepping the condo for rent.  Then I've got to get cleaning supplies, hang the christmas lights, fertilize the lawn, go to the dump and then next week I'm heading to NOLA for [Do It With Drupal](http://www.doitwithdrupal.com/,) which promises to be a ton of fun.

Anyhoo, I've got another blog post in the works here that I'll get posted today or tomorrow.  It's going to be long and inspired.  I promise.  Until then, drink a cup of hot chocolate, throw another log on the fire, and sing another Christmas Carol!
