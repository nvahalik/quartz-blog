Do It With Drupal has been great so far!  Met lots of people and have been having a great time!  We went out to eat last night at Bourbon House Seafood on Bourbon Street:

It's a wonderful place.  Great food and not too pricey!  Seafood platter = win.

The conference came up to full speed this morning and there has never been a dull moment.  Lots of great ideas and some good conversations.

So far, a few thoughts:

* There are a *lot* of .edus here.  50% or more at least.
* I've heard "we have _that_ problem, too" a lot.  People feel less dumb knowing that others are running into the same problem as they are.
* Themes seem to cause more "issues" than any other piece of Drupal. (You know, as opposed to modules or things not working right.)
