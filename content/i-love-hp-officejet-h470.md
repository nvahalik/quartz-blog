A couple of years ago, while doing research for a class my boss was teaching our agents for CE credit, I helped present a "mobile" office.  My presentation showed a fully mobile office that had a:

* printer,
* laptop,
* internet

All working without the need for an outlet.

The printer I chose was the [HP H470wbt Officejet Mobile Printer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Z1UZ8?ie=UTF8&tag=nickvaha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0010Z1UZ8)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nickvaha-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0010Z1UZ8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

So two years ago, I bought the printer, set it up, printed 2 pages, stored it for a year, printed 2 more pages, and never touched it again until 2 days ago.  I half-expected the ink to be dry and gunky, or something to have busted on this little guy since he traveled 400+ miles in the bed of a truck.

This thing prints like a color laser: sharp, fast, and no smudges!  I am impressed.  Truly a fine piece of mobile printing machinery.
