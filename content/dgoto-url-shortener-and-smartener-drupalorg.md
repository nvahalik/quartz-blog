The last day of DrupalCon, after talking to several people about drupal.org URLs, dgo.to was born.  It's goal is to make drupal.org URLs easy and smarter.  For instance, where else can see someone's profile by just typing their name?

Anyhoo, check out the site itself: [dgo.to](http://dgo.to/) or [this post on d.o](http://dgo.to/783692) for more information.

Any comments & suggestions are welcome!
