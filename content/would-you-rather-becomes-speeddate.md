Finally read about the Facebook Application [Would You Rather suddenly becoming SpeedDate](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/O3J3gngSvxw/) on [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/.)  What a slimy tactic.  Why are applications even allowed to change their name?  You would think they wouldn't allow it.
