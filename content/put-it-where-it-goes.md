Why can't people just make the bodies of e-mails the content?  Why do they insist on putting an entirely new message in a Word Doc, attaching that to a message, and then sending that message?  *Put it in the freaking body of the e-mail!*  It's not that hard.  

I don't want to have to click to open the document and then have to delete the document.  It's not like there are graphics or pretty colors.  Just names, and dates.  

*Put it in the e-mail body, where it belongs!*
