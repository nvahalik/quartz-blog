I finally replaced a ZAMP helmet that I had received when purchasing my old bike with a [Shoei RF 1100 Firestrike](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XNP9WG?ie=UTF8&tag=nickvaha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002XNP9WG)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nickvaha-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002XNP9WG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

This is a great helmet.  The only problem was that it whistled at 60+ mph.  Turns out that all you have to do is make a couple of adjustments to make it stop.

<ol><li>Push against these clips on both sides to remove the face shield.</li>
<li>Loosen (do not remove!) these screws. About a half-turn is all you need.</li>
<li>Push the whole shield assembly towards the back of the helmet.</li>
<li>Hold the assembly and tighten the screws in step 2.</li>
</ol>

That's it!  The shield should be held against the gasket properly and there should be no more whistling.
