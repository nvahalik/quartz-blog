I started using Jujutsu exclusively[^1] last week. The first few days were rough. Getting my mind right with bookmarks/branches and re-learning things like what rebase does has been interesting.

The [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dkmfj3aGQN) has been helpful.

There is the [SelveJJ](https://selvejj.com) plugin for JetBrains IDEs. I've installed it but haven't been able to get it working properly.

## Personal Snippets
```
jj diff --git | claude -p "Write a commit message reviewing the following changes. Do not add Generated by Claude Code. Output ONLY the commit message." | jj describe --stdin --edit
```

[^1]: I ran into a problem where—I'm pretty sure—what happened was that I had a branch where I had merged in the upstream commits but forgot that I had done that. Later, I was editing code in a descendent commit and had run `jj absorb`. When I tried to merge everything it went completely sideways and somehow I ended up actually merging most of the current branch with the upstream changes. I ended up going back into `git` to figure out what really happened.
