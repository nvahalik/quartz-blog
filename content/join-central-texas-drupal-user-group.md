After talking with some friends and colleagues, it seemed about time to go ahead and start up the [Central Texas Drupal Group](http://groups.drupal.org/central-texas.)  Once we get enough people, we'll start meeting (monthly most likely).  Since the distribution of people is split 50/50 Waco/Temple, the location of the next people that join will decide which city we'll meet in.

Sign up now, and let anyone else you know of know so we can form a group of developers in Central Texas!
