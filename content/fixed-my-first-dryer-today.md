I have an old GE Dryer (Model # DDE5300BBL) downstairs.  The belt popped in it about a month ago and I finally got around to fixing it.  Unscrewed everything, cleaned it, but then I couldn't find out how the belt fit.  Luckily, everything is on the internet.

Had I shopped a little harder, I could've gotten the belt for [about $6](http://cgi.ebay.com/GE-WE12X82P-Dryer-Belt-WE12X82-New-fits-Hotpoint-RCA-GE_W0QQitemZ380065144859QQihZ025QQcategoryZ20714QQcmdZViewItem,) but I ended up spending about [$18 with shipping](http://www.partstore.com/Part/General+Electric/General+Electric/WE12X82/New.aspx.)  Taking the thing apart was easy.  Cleaning the beast was a task, taking about 40 minutes and several trips to empty the vacuum.  Then the belt wouldn't fit right.  Turns out I was doin it rong.  Oh well.  A couple more google searches led me to a that describe [how to change a GE dryer belt](http://www.applianceaid.com/ge-dryers.html#belt) (among other things).  Great little site.  Now my dryer is happily spinning away and the repair only took about an hour total.
