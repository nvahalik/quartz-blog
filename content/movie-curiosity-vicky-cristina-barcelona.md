This morning, I finally managed to finish <a type="amzn">No Country For Old Men</a>.  It was great.  One of those genre overlapping movies that doesn't fit into any one particular category.  You might say it was basically a "chase" movie (as the Coen brothers called it).

The bad guy in that movie is [Javier Bardem](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000849/.)  He's so good at it.  Really great.  As it turns out, he is going to be in [Vicky Cristina Barcelona](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497465/) as well.

It's a little deja vÃ¹ with what [Gerard Butler](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124930/) did with [300](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/) and [P.S. I Love You](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431308/.)  One minute, the guy is a total ultimate badass putting fear and animosity into the hearts of any intelligent soul, the next he's the reason all the lady's are wishfully sighing and getting all teary-eyed.

His performance in this movie will be a very interesting contrast to what we've seen of him in NCFOM[1].

fn1.  Considering that I've only seen him in one other thing, my scope is limited.  You might already know he's a great actor.
