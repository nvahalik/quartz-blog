Tuesday, 11:55 AM, my boss comes into my office and tells me that he needs to broadcast a message to all of our agents.  After some google searches, I finally landed at [Vontoo.com](http://vontoo.com/).  Their site was clean, sign-up was pretty impressive, and the overall experience from their site and service has made me feel good about recommending them and talking about them.

Their [account creation process](http://www.vontoo.com/try-it.shtml) is really cool.  You type in your name, phone number, password, etc... and then the system calls you.  You hit '1' on your phone to verify your information, and about 3-4 seconds later, your screen refreshes and you are automatically logged into their website.  Awesome!

Their member area is very clean.  Their "express" version (the version I signed up for) is very simple and straightforward.  The same processes that one would use with sending a mass e-mail marketing messages applies, except it's even easier.  One of the coolest things by far is the statistics.

Very nice being able to see how well it performed.  Billing is done by minutes, a minute for each call, basically.  You can do pre-paid or look at their advanced accounts.

If you've got the need to do phone-based mass communications, [Vontoo](http://vontoo.com/) is really great way to handle it!  Their staff was friendly, support guys definitely helpful, and they definitely gave me the feeling of going "above and beyond."  Check them out!
