Back in October 2008, my wife started working at Texas Motorsports in Killeen.  I met most of her co-workers at the Christmas party that December.  That was the first time I met Kole:

Floyd, Erin's husband, was deployed in Iraq for most of 2009.  As a result, Erin & my wife, Sarah, got to spend a lot of time together.  And usually where Erin came, Kole came as well.

Kole died in an accident March 7th, 2010.  The details don't matter, but most it is believed he died in his sleep.

Floyd and Erin managed to, above everything in this world, love Kole more than you could possibly imagine.  From the countless photos on Facebook, to the toys scattered all over the floor you didn't have to ask if they loved their child, it was apparent from the very moment you saw them.

Kole will be sorely missed not only by his mother and father, but by anyone and everyone who knew him.

Sarah and I made this video for them and we'd like to share it to remember him by:
