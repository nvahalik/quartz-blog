I had a conversation with a friend last night and during this conversation, they said that they didn't want to argue about abortion because "no one knows!  is it murder?  is it not?"

There are some people that don't know the answer to that question.  But some people, _especially_ Christians should know the answer to that question.

bq.  "I do.  I understand that nowhere in the bible does it dictate that it is a baby at conception"

I have to admit when I heard this, I was absolutely shocked.  I wonder if this person has read their bible lately.  The bible indicates that we are created by God, for God.  Each and every one of us.

What matters here is the understanding that God creates life.  *All* life is precious.  If you call yourself a Christian and think that a "fetus" is not life, then you need to seriously revisit your beliefs.

Maybe this will jog your memory:

Jeremiah 1:5 says "Before *I formed you* in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart;..." (he is, of course, speaking to Jeremiah, but these apply to us also.)

David writes in Psalm 139:13 "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb."

"Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb? (Job 31:15)  It's very apparent.  Job understands this.  Why don't you?
