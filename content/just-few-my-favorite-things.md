I'm horrible on keeping track of stuff.  I've lost more crap and misplaced more stuff than anyone I know.  For a while, "pulling a Nick" involved having something in your hand one minute, and forgetting where you put it the next.  Ladies and gentlemen, yours truly is a changed man.  Enter [Things from Cultured Code](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/.)

Things is, by far, the most used program on my Mac aside from [Textmate](http://macromates.com/.)  If you are a busy person, are just plain forgetful and need a way to manage everything you've got going on, then you really have to try it.  Give it a couple of weeks.  I had to use it for about 3 weeks before it really started to kick in.  Combined with [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero,) Things has allowed me to become _extremely_ productive.  So productive, in fact, that I find myself visiting [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) less and having more time.  In fact, my office is much cleaner than it has been in the past few months.

My boss has even stopped by to ask me what has happened that has made me so much more efficient.  I can't brag about Things enough!

Try the beta now for free!  If you [sign up now, you'll get a discount when the release it this summer](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/#subscription_form.)  There is also a [client out for the iPhone](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/iphone/.)   It's only [$9.99 right now in the App Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284971781&mt=8,) and doesn't support syncing (although it's [coming soon](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/iphone/faq.html).)

You definitely won't regret it.  Really.  No, really.
