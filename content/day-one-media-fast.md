Well, it has been 24 hours since I last looked Facebook.  I turned off notifications on my phone and went a step further on my laptop.  I have this bad habit of creating a new tab and then tapping F-A-<enter> and letting autocomplete finish the job.  To help me get away from this, I used MAMP and set up a new virtual host for the domains that I use frequently to distract myself:

All-in-all while I was still somewhat distracted today, I had other things and people distracting me and the time that I wasn't being distracted (which is really the wrong word for it as I was actually helping and doing productive activities)... at any rate _I felt less distracted_ than normal.

So that seems to be a success.

Twitter and YouTube were far easier since most of the time I click on links in group Skype chats or IRC channels.  However those are blocked too.

On a side note, I did find a rather neat little application called [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) today that allows you to package application environments (OS / Stack) and code in single package format that can be distributed to others.  Pretty nifty.
