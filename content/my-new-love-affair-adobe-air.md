While at php|tek this past week, I attended a session by [Ed Finkler](http://funkatron.com/) called [Building Desktop RIAs with PHP, HTML and Javascript in AIR](http://tek.phparch.com/c/schedule/talk/d2s3/0.)  At first, I was skeptical.  Surely, this was all too good to be true.

Duly inspired, I set off hacking on my own application.  After a little while (roughly an hour), I had a fairly impressive mock-up of my application going.

After downloading some more apps from [Adobe Application Exchange](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=productHome&exc=24&loc=en_us,) the whole idea of what Adobe is doing with AIR finally hit me.  This is opening up real rapid application development to a whole slew of people who don't know those "real" languages like C#, C++, Objective-C, or Java.

Anyway, it's awesome and you should try it out.
