This past weekend, I went to the [Call to Discernment](http://www.justinpeters.org/overview.htm) over in Tulsa, OK.  It was by God's grace and providence that I went.  I knew that the point was going to be learning about the [Word of Faith movement](http://www.gotquestions.org/Word-Faith.html...) however I got far more than I bargained for.  Lots more.

The one thing that I can say to summarize everything that was taught was this: *Hold God and his word above all else. If you can do that, your life and witness will exhibit it and everything else will seem dull in comparison.*

If you want to be able to discern what is right and what is good, then you know mud know what is right and good.  What is right and good?  God alone (Luke 18:19).  So if you want to know what is right and good, know the Lord.  How do you know the Lord?  Through his word.  Mark 12:14.

At any rate, one of the other things that was presented there was about an answer to the question of "How do I know what to do with me life?"  Often times, I've asked myself how do I know what God wants me to do about _x_?  I had no idea.  I know there are times when the Lord puts burdens on peoples hearts.  But what about those big decisions?  This was the advice I heard (paraphrased):

Devote yourself to him (Matthew 6:33).  Know him by his word.  Pray to him (Philipians 4:6,7).  Compare yourself to the scriptures to see if you are abiding.  And then... act.

It almost seems too simple.  But I am definitely going to test this.
