Saw [this article on Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/06/10/adium-1-3-beta-brings-new-contact-organization-performance) earlier, and had to try it out.  Latest beta of Adium has a Facebook module.  Sure enough, it works like a charm.  I can see and chat to everyone just as if they had IM, all from the comfort of Adium.

*UPDATE:* It appears that by using this module, it continuously logs you out of your browser session.  Trying to browse the Facebook site while logged into the IM client through Adium was a painful experience.  Just FYI.
