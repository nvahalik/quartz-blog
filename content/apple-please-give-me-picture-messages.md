Normally, I'm not much of a complainer.  But this is one of those things that I was *sure* would have eventually been fixed by now.  Perhaps my thought process is lacking something.

Why doesn't the iPhone have Multimedia messaging?  I can e-mail photos, [&ldquo;text smarter than any smartphone,&rdquo;](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/sms.html) and watch Youtube but I can't get a picture of my little brother and Jordan with funny masks on at the halloween store sent from another mobile phone.  It is rather ridiculous.

To add insult to injury, whenever you actually do receive an MMS, AT&T sends you a link to a site called [viewmymessage.com](http://www.viewmymessage.com/en/legacy/login.jsp.)  This would be a fair trade-off for the time being if it actually *worked*.  It doesn't.  To view messages sent to your iPhone, you have to have patience to wait for the site to load and a device that can run flash.  The site doesn't even attempt to load on my iPhone.

Earlier, on the picture in question, it took 2 attempts about 70 seconds to view a small, hard to see picture that I can't save to my machine.  Simply unacceptable.

Apple is always about the experience, and to be honest, this experience sucks.
