Just bought the [Transmit 4](http://panic.com/transmit) upgrade.  Having used Transmit 3 for several years, the UI improvements are a big deal.  It seems like some of the nit-picky stuff irked me was fixed and overall the app feels worth the $19 upgrade.

Panic has always been detailed oriented.  Their site has always been easy to use and a pleasure to navigate.  One thing that caught my eye while purchasing Transmit 4 was the checkout button:

My only complaint after having gone through the process was that this button is mislabeled.  But it looks like a normal button, right?  Well, it's not.  Because as you fill out the form:

The button transforms:

Continue filling out the form:

And it fills out more.

Until you've filled out every required field:

Very cool!
