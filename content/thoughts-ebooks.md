In my previous post, I mentioned that my wife had gotten me a Kindle
Fire for Christmas and that I read nearly every day on it. It is no
surprise to me that this morning, while going through my News Reader, I
happened upon this [article over at Coding
Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/books-bits-vs-atoms.html).
He discusses the pros and cons of both printed and eBooks and summarizes
his thoughts thusly:

> “Because I love words, I want to love eBooks. I
want to buy lots and lots of eBooks. But unless the publishers are
willing to treat eBooks with the same respect and care that they give to
their printed books – and most importantly of all, adjust their pricing
to reflect the brave new economy of bits, and not an antiquated economy
of atoms – they’re destined to eventually suffer the same fate as the
Encyclopedia Britannica.” 

I, too, have noticed that the quality of the
eBooks i’ve purchased are less median. To a large degree, my expectation
while reading was that I’d be getting a high-quality item. Admittedly,
most of the books i’ve read so far are not oriented towards large
graphical items. Some might have a few tables or small images, but for
the most part they are complementary and not required of the items being
read for understanding. 

That said, you can absolutely *tell* when a
publisher has cared about their eBook. For instance, take this book:
[Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Quick Christian Guide to the Mormon
Holy
Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SS582C/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=nickvaha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002SS582C).
The tables, images, and chapter headings rendered perfectly. The images
showed up, the footnotes worked, and the book itself was formatted
properly overall. Compared to, say, [The Book of Revelation Made
Easy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QCYPW0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nickvaha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001QCYPW0).
Even the comments on this book reflect the poor quality of the book on
the Kindle. While the book was ultimately readable, quotes did not
render properly and the tables sometimes did not render properly across
pages. 

The [free
books](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_355831402_49?ie=UTF8&node=2245146011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-1&pf_rd_r=169QKXK9JK48SY3VNDAJ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1362025062&pf_rd_i=1286228011)
are far worse. The chapter headings do not work. Footnotes (if any)
usually never function. Images are missing. The table of contents does
not link accurately. It is as if someone took the text of the book, used
notepad to edit it, and then exported it to an eBook without any
testing. Granted, they are **free**, but when free mean low quality? And
that low quality without the paid books having impeccable quality.

I do
enjoy and will continue to purchase eBooks. However, feedback to
publishers about the lack of quality in those electronically published
copies needs to be strong and flowing if we are ever going to see the
quality of those eBooks go up.
