Been really quiet since Do It With Drupal.  Life has taken a few exciting turns the past few months.  I got engaged to my Fianc√©, Sarah!  I've completely moved out of my old place and into the new house.  There is still quite a bit of work to be done on the Condo, but it is moving along (albeit at a snail's pace).  My weekends are pretty much spent between that, Church, and just hanging out with Sarah and friends.

I've started going to GymX down the road to shed some unwanted poundage as a new year's resolution.  So far, so good.  I've lost about 8 pounds or so.  Sarah got me a grill for Christmas and man, have I been using it!  Chicken, fish, steaks, potatoes, corn, scallops, squash, you name it!  It's taken some getting used to... but it's been tasty and healthy.

I haven't really spent much time working on my side-gig.  Partially because it's really calmed down and partially because my role at RVOS has taken over.  There is a lot of exciting stuff going on and some new opportunities that will be making themselves available really soon.

Originally, the idea of moving here to Temple seemed really dull and death by boredom seemed like a possible outcome.  I haven't really felt any of that.  The fact that I can go home and watch some TV, fire up the grill and have dinner is very soothing.  The ability to wake up at 7, make breakfast (a real one) and get read and leave 10 minutes before work (and be early!) is great.  One of the best decisions I have ever made.

As things settle down more over the next few weeks/months... I will hopefully get some time to start working on my Drupal contrib plans again.  Until then!
