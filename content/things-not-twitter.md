A few days ago some friends and I were talking about someone's wedding plans and joked that instead of getting it photographed, you could just live blog/twitter it.  That is probably _not_ the best way to handle a wedding, but it is even less of a good way to handle [a 3 year old's funeral](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~3/YDfAWenlTTo/things-better-left-off-twitter-the-funeral-of-a-3-year-old-boy)
