Wow... this is pretty cool.  Looks like anyone who got charged an Early Termination Fee between July 23, 1999 thru August 10, 2008 might be eligible for a settlement.

Go to [http://www.verizonetfsettlement.com/](http://www.verizonetfsettlement.com/) for more information.  I filled out mine this morning!
