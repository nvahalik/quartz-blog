I have a big problem reading God's Word every day.  My boss gave me daily-read bible that you through everything chronologically.  It's great and I really look forward to reading it.  But i'm behind a couple of days now, but I'll catch up this afternoon.  Sunday afternoons are always my catch-up days.  (Right now it's going through Leviticus and Numbers, which, imo(In My Opinion) are semi-boring because they are very repetitious.)

I had a conversation with myself a couple days ago.  It went something like this:

"Why didn't I read the Bible today?"
"Because I was busy."
"Yes, but watched 5 youtube videos and looked at lolcats for almost 10 minutes during lunch."
"Well, yeah, that was taking a break."
"God's Word = best break evar."
"I didn't have my bible handy."
"Perhaps you've used [BibleGateway](http://biblegateway.com/) or [Youversion](http://youversion.com/)?"
"Yeah, but what am I supposed to read?"
"[This](http://youversion.com/1yearbible)."
"Yeah, but I'm not always at my computer..."
"[Ownt](http://youversion.com/iphone)."

Unless you are phone-less, computer-less, and bible-less, there really isn't a reason to not dive in, even for a little bit, every day.  We need it to survive.  Our spiritual food.  I'll skip the cheesy analogies that our Pastor gave us a few weeks ago and skip straight to the meat.  Living a Christian life in this world takes so much.  I can't tell you how many times I can feel anger in my heart or how many times I almost (or do) speak harsh words to someone.  No matter how much I try to cover up that those words were rooted in truth, you would never tell because they were shaped and brought forth by anger and not love.

[The Word of God is a seed](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=8&version=31.)  A little bit of it gets put in us when we our saved, but it is our duty to make sure it is cared for so that it [grows and produces fruit](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=15&version=31.)  We are expected to be grow and do something with what God gives us.  [The Parable of the talents Matthew 25:15-30](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=25&version=31) gives us a really clear picture of the expectations that God puts on us.  It's a lot of work, really.  But it's all worth it.

After all, we get God's protection with his Word in us.  Ephesians 6:17 says [Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=56&chapter=6&version=31.)  His Word is also our protection.  Like I said in my last post, being able to lean back on the sturdiest foundation of all has been my best defense against the one who would rather not see me thrive in Christ.

There are so many ways to get into the Word.  [BibleGateway](http://biblegateway.com/) was my favorite for quite some time, but [YouVersion](http://youversion.com/) seems to have a much more interesting interface and is really made for people like me (web-enabled, bloggers, etc).  I go back and forth between the two.  If you know of any other good ones, please e-mail me or add a comment.
