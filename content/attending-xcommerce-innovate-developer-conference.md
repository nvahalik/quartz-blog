Tomorrow, several other [Classy Llamas](http://classyllama.com/)) and I will be heading to San Francisco to attend the [x.commerce](http://x.com/) [Innovate Developers Conference](http://www.innovate-conference.com/!)  This is very exciting for a couple of reasons:

# The idea of x.commerce is very ambitious.  It is the first platform that aims to be first full-spectrum, end-to-end eCommerce platform.  It's exciting to be a part of something like that.
# Secondly, Magento will be testing their [Beta Developer Certification Exam](http://www.innovate-conference.com/)  I've been a big supporter of this and it will be awesome to be one of the first to take this new exam and become a Certified Magento Developer!
#  Lastly, it will be great to meet & greet the other Magento developers and partners.

We'll be updating our [Classy Llama blog](http://classyllama.com/blog/) with updates as we can!
