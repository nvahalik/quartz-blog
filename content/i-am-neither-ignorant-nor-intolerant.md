After moving out of Waco, I truly feel that a veil has been lifted from my eyes.  As if, suddenly I am able to reason and think clearly.  There are many benefits to this, however it has pretty much made me an outsider politically and socially as far as my views and beliefs are concerned.  Some are open to this idea, and I am appreciative to this.  Some however, are pretty much convinced that my views and beliefs make me both "ignorant" and "intolerant."

And to those that think that I am both ignorant and intolerant, I will present the evidence that you are the ignorant, intolerant one.

Firstly, I have the right to speak my mind about whatever I want.  Yes, I think Obama was the worst possibly choice for president.  Yes, I think abortion is wrong.  Indeed, the bible tells us that homosexuality *is a sin* and is wrong.  Now, these are *my* views, and it just so happens that these views are not only shared with me by my wife, the members of our church and many of our friends.  You might consider it intolerant, that I oppose "women's rights" or homosexuality.  Friend, the moment you disrespect my *right* to express myself, you yourself are showing intolerance.

I was listening to a radio show a few days ago and they were talking about how the word "discriminate" used to have a positive connotation.  A person with "discriminating tastes" only like the best.  It was a good thing to be labeled discriminating in certain respects.

But now, the world is crazy, and a group of people who are already have equal protection under the law want something that I don't think they deserve: the right to call their union a "marriage."  If I am ignorant and intolerant, then so were the millions and millions of people who came before me who thought the same way.  You see it as intolerance, but I say it's calling it what it really is.  Homosexual relationships can never be fully equal to a real marriage.  It's physiologically and spiritually impossible.  And if you think can read all of the material that has brought us this far and conclude that something in there says otherwise... then you probably need to really re-evaluate your reading and/or comprehension abilities.

Another thing:  I know several gay couples, not many on a very personal basis, but I've worked with a few over the years.  I don't think they are bad people.  I've never hated gays, or talked down to them or even treated them any differently than I did and I attempt to be respectful and polite.  Do I approve of their relationship?  No.  I still think it's wrong, but there is a difference between these people and the people I read about in the newspaper.

None of these people make a big deal about it.  It is *not* the *defining factor of their lives*.  I do have a problem with people who make it their goal to impress on others a lifestyle which for the past, you know, 5000 years, has been looked at as physically unhealthy, spiritually sinful, and socially disgraceful.  They want it to be actively accepted like "regular" people and you know what?  *I won't stand for it.*

If you want to live your life quietly and don't want to involve me or flaunt your "pride" up and down the street, that is fine, and I can respect that.  So what is it?  Am I intolerant?  Tolerant?  Confused, mistaken, or maybe just fed up?  How about ignorant?  Am I missing something here?  I'm all ears.  You can e-mail me, call me, or reply here.

P.S. Obama, you've officially ruined June.
