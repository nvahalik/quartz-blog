Very proud to announce my first contributed drupal module!  [Permission Report](http://drupal.org/project/usage/permission_report:)

bq. Permission Report calculates and displays permissions a user has and shows which roles grant those permissions. It also provides ability to list users in a role, look at role membership information, view which users have a particular permission, and dig down into complicated role and permission problems.

Hope that this is the first of many contributions to come!
