As a side note, the new, druplified [Netoteric site is now live](http://netoteric.com/).  The intention was to do a 1-to-1 conversion of the old site (which was just hand-coded... yes I know, tsk tsk).  The result was almost a complete pixel-for-pixel duplication of the site.  There were some changes made on the newer site: links removed, text changed... but other than that, it's almost a perfect replication.

Just in case you were wondering, [Netoteric](http://netoteric.com/) is a company I started in January 2007 that builds and hosts websites and software.  Now you know... the rest of the story.
