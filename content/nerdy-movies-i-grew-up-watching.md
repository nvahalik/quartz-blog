I was thinking a few nights ago while listening to the Hacker's soundtrack that there were a ton of movies I watched growing while either growing up or while I was in college. Some of these I watched a lot...

Anyway, I wanted to record this here for posterity... don't want to forget them!

1. [War Games (1983)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/) - This is the move that started it all for me. I remember watching this a lot and thinking how cool it was that the protagonist had a computer in his room. This movie has it all: suspense, nerdery, hacking skills, a little romance, and a happy ending. I did a little war-dialing when I was a kid and this movie was what I felt like I was doing. (Rather than making my mom upset because I was calling numbers I shouldn't have.)

2. [Sneakers (1992)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/) - The original hacking movie. It has everything: social engineering, computer hacking, code-breaking... you name it! And it has Robert Redford. What's not to like? My favorite scene is the scene where he bypasses the temperature sensor by walking really slowly.

3. [The Net (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/) - Sandra Bullock was a big teenage heart-throb. Who doesn't like nerdy girls? She is an amazing thriller actress. Speed only came out the year before. This is a staple nerd-flick if there ever was one.

4. [Hackers (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) - Ah. This is "the" movie that I can remember watching over and over. The thrill of the hack, the "sticking it to" the big guys. Having a commanding knowledge of technology in this age made one feel like a deityâ€”and these guys made it look cool, too.

5. [Mission Impossible (1996)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/) - Not so much a hacker movie but there was a pretty good component to it. The feels when they were on the train and their upload failed.

6. [Pirates of Silicon Vally (1999)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/) - Noah Wyle played Steve Jobs in this made-for-TV docu-drama exploring Apple and Microsoft in the build-up to the 21st centry. I don't remember much about it, other than I watched it a bunch.

7. [Antitrust (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218817/) - Another thriller. This movie came out while I was in high-school. I really idolized the way this story was played out as I felt like I connected with the main character.

8. [Operation Takedown (2000)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159784/) - This one was about Kevin Mitnick. We studied his case some in college and I remember watching this once or twice. No matter how careful you are it seems that your sins will always find you out.

9. [Revolution OS (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308808/) - A documentary about Linux. Nothing special, but I watched it over and over again in college... on my Slackware machine.

## (Dis)honorable Mentions

* [Swordfish (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244/) - I think I watched more clips of this than ever watching the movie, but it was pretty talked about in college. A brief search should find out why that was the case.

* [Live Free or Die Hard (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/) - Another   hacker movie... with violence. Not a bad movie but I don't remember liking this one much at all.

Did you have a movie that was formative in your life?
