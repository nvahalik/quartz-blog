It has been one of my dreams for the longest time to go on a mission trip to another country.  I'm happy that prayer has finally been answered!  At the end of July, we're going to Haiti with a group out of Kansas City, Missouri.

The goal is to work with an established project there: Joshua's Village, a village for abandoned, orphaned and neglected special needs and at-risk children.

The cost of the trip is $1,400, not including all of the required medicines and vaccinations or the travel fees since we don't live in Missouri.  If you'd like to help, with financial stuff, please let me know.  I am taking donations!

Also, prayer support is really needed.  It seems like after our first visit to the doctor to get shots, questions really started to pop up after we started reading the travel guidelines.  It's definitely outside of my comfort zone!  Being away from home for more than 3 days has always made me feel uneasy, but in a country where diseases are running rampant, kidnappings are common, and a curfew is the law... gosh.  However, the need is greater than my fear -- pray it stays that way!

My mentor at church has said that the enemy will throw all sorts of nasty things to discourage us especially when doing something like this.  I can definitely feel it already.

So I hope that even if you are unable to provide financially, you will pray for me, Jessa, and our entire group, as we embark on this journey together.
