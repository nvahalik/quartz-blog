This is pretty much how it's been lately.  Finding some new things to write about as I go along but this is pretty much the first day I haven't been hard at work since I first woke up.  And, sadly, this is probably what the outlook looks like for the next few months.  I've decided to quit my full-time job and focus my efforts fully on [Netoteric](http://netoteric.com/.)

I've already given advanced notice so that projects I'm working on will have enough time to finish and other departments can set appropriate timelines before February.  It's going to be a long, tough road... but ultimately I believe everything will be much better off than when I started and the company will have a good infrastructure to build on for the next 5-10 years as it grows.

It seems lately that it's been an uphill battle to make progress and finish projects.  Lots of different sides demanding attention and need things done to keep the flow going.  Recently, the server Netoteric hosts on was updated to PHP 5.2.6 from PHP 4.4.4.  This was an unexpected upgrade, but now that it's done, it feels like more of a blessing than a burden having to update some of the old sites that have been hosted on that box for more than 3 years.

The outlook is incredible bright, and there are good things ahead!
