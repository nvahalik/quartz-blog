The cruise to Cozumel was amazing.  Probably one of the best parts was turning my phone off for 5 days.  At first I wasn't sure if I could do it... but we got through it and it was such an amazing experience that I would love to do again.

While I was on vacation, I read <a type="amzn" asin="0441012035">Neuromancer</a> and started reading <a type="amzn" asin="1585426393">The Dumbest Generation</a>.  Neuromancer was a great book.  It was way ahead of it's time, and if you have seen the Matrix and never read this book, you should.  This book was written by the guy who brought into existence the words "cyberspace" and "matrix."  Totally worth the read.

The Dumbest Generation is about the death of reading in America's youth.  So far it's been very eye-opening.  I'm only about 1/3 of the way through it, but I'm going to try to get through it over the course of the next week.

Turning my phone back on after getting home only yielded 3 voicemails (2 about one thing, and 1 that wasn't for me), 100 e-mails (already gone through and finished), and 1 txt message.  Not bad.

I've still got some time this weekend to get re-acclimated to life outside of vacation.  That's great because my brain is still in vacation mode!  Got more stuff going trying to get my business in a better state.  We'll see where it is in 5 months!
