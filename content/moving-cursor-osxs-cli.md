Just found this [great little article over at superuser.com](http://superuser.com/questions/131938/how-to-skip-words-in-os-x-terminal) about how you can use <code>meta-b</code> and <code>meta-f</code> to use backwords and forwards by words in the CLI.  Since there is no meta key, you have to use ?-b and ?-f (escape as meta).

Optionally, you can set the option key as meta in Terminal's settings:
